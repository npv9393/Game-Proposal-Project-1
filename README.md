### Gameplay

The player uses WASD and the spacebar to control the Space Force Vector3 spacefighter as they dodge Professor Croon's attacks. Remeber your skills at Galaga? They will help a bit here because we aren't going to explain them to you.

### The Story

Take command of your Vector3 spacefighter. The United States is under attack from the alien being Professor Croon. The Space Force has been formed in order to combat this new foe. Protect the Earth from his synth skills.

### Platform

Space Force will be desktop only as because you will need WASD to control your ship.

### Esthetics

The 80s are back baby, so lace up your converse, grab your back to the future lunchbox, and start hating the Soviet Union again because there is no way that the awesomely ridiculous Space Force could exist anywhere but here.
